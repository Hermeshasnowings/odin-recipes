    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 onion - peeled and diced</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic - peeled and chopped/crushed</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic - peeled and minced</li>
        <li>800 g (4 cups) boiled and cooled long-grain rice - (this is about 1 â…“ cups (300g) dried rice that has been
            boiled in water</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Fry onion in a little oil in the wok, then add minced garlic and cook for further 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the rice, knock up the heat to high and drizzle over a little sesame oil. Toss everything together with
            a spatula. Note: Using a spatula is important as it allows you to get underneath the rice and toss it,
            rather than break up the rice grains (if you were to stir with a spoon for example).</li>
        <li>Once the rice is hot, push the rice over to the side of the pan and crack in two eggs</li>
    </ol>
